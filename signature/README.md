# How to run

- *python recognition.py*: to compute the features from the input files and iterate through all
the verification set and do the predictions(genuine or forgeries)


**Note:** the gt.txt file is the ground truth file given with the exercises(now it's useless) and
the enrollment and verification datasets are from the *validation* data(we didn't include the ones
given with the exercise)
