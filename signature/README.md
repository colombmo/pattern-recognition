# How to run

- *python recognition.py* : to compute the features from the input files and iterate through all
the verification set and do the predictions(genuine or forgeries).


**Note:** the enrollment and verification datasets are from the *validation* data(we didn't include the ones
given with the exercise also we didn't include the gt.txt file).
Also on the *recognition.py* you can see that we have commented out the part that measures the accuracy
because we didn't have the gt.txt file, just add the gt.txt file and comment it out when you want to test accuracy.
